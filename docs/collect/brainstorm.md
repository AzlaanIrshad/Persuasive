## Template-based Diagnostic Generation


# This idea involves creating a standard template for the diagnostic report, which can be automatically populated with the data from the lab. The algorithm would simply replace the placeholder text in the template with the relevant information from the lab data, generating a complete diagnostic report that is ready for the general practitioner to read.

# Advantages:

- Easy to implement and maintain
- Ensures a consistent format for all diagnostic reports
- Reduces the time and effort required for manual report generation

# Disadvantages:

- May not accommodate all types of lab data and may require customization for each specific use case
- May not provide the level of detail or insight required for some diagnoses
- Could lead to oversimplification or misinterpretation of the results if the template is not designed properly.


## Brainstorm
Show a list with all the results of the bloodtest and set them on a list. The worst result shows first to make it easy for the GP to see what's wrong with the patient and what could possibally be the treatment to help the patient.

Upload the encrypted data of the bloodtest to the cloud where it gets used to display the stats on the patient his logs.

A user friendly page for the GP so he can just search for the name of the client and get their information so he can diagnose his patient. Nothing complicating about the site just a login with two-step verification and a timeout when the user has bot pressed a key for longer then 5 to 10 minutes.

### Advantages
The advantage of making the screen easy to read for the GP is because they have limited time per patient and it would save a lot of time when it's already calculated and made in a excel format.

Another advantage is when the GP can see the previous history of the patient so he/she doesn't need to use a different tool to see help diagnose the patient there problem.

## Brainstorm

## Template-based Diagnostic Generation


# This idea involves creating a standard template for the diagnostic report, which can be automatically populated with the data from the lab. The algorithm would simply replace the placeholder text in the template with the relevant information from the lab data, generating a complete diagnostic report that is ready for the general practitioner to read.

# Advantages:

- Easy to implement and maintain
- Ensures a consistent format for all diagnostic reports
- Reduces the time and effort required for manual report generation

# Disadvantages:

- May not accommodate all types of lab data and may require customization for each specific use case
- May not provide the level of detail or insight required for some diagnoses
- Could lead to oversimplification or misinterpretation of the results if the template is not designed properly.

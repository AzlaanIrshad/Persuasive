# Summary
The company's issue is that they don't know how to convert the data from their lab to a simple diagnostic that the GP can read. We need to make a algorithm that converts data from their lab to a simple dyasnostic that the GP can read. It should be all encrypted because of safety reasons. It needs to be working and if possible we could add exta's such as a patient dossier.

## Brainstorm
Show a list with all the results of the bloodtest and set them on a list. The worst result shows first to make it easy for the GP to see what's wrong with the patient and what could possibally be the treatment to help the patient.

Upload the encrypted data of the bloodtest to the cloud where it gets used to display the stats on the patient his logs.

A user friendly page for the GP so he can just search for the name of the client and get their information so he can diagnose his patient. Nothing complicating about the site just a login with two-step verification and a timeout when the user has bot pressed a key for longer then 5 to 10 minutes.

### Advantages
The advantage of making the screen easy to read for the GP is because they have limited time per patient and it would save a lot of time when it's already calculated and made in a excel format.

Another advantage is when the GP can see the previous history of the patient so he/she doesn't need to use a different tool to see help diagnose the patient there problem.
